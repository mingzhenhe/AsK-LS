# AsK-LS
This repository contains code implementing the algorithm proposed by Mingzhen He, Fan He, Lei Shi, Xiaolin Huang and Johan A.K. Suykens in [Learning with Asymmetric Kernels : Least Squares and Feature Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01397).
The code of Least squares support vector machine with asymmetric kernels.

[Python versions](https://github.com/AntoineXCC/AsK-LS) are written by Antoine Xie and Edmond You as part of the Summer Research Internship - Project 58 Advanced Kernel Methods or Machine Learning at Shanghai Jiao Tong University
